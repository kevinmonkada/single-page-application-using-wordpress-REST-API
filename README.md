# Single-page-application-wordpress-rest-api

JavaScript project SPA

Please <a href="https://kevinmonkada.github.io/single-page-application-using-wordpress-REST-API/">Click here</a> to see the project itself.

You can change the variable NAME found on the wp_api.js file to see any blog based on a Wordpress site, and you will see how this SPA will work for any wordpress site that has tons of blogs that you want to read. For this example we are using "css-tricks" to gather all of their latests posts with an infinite scroll, a blog search option and even a working contact form for you to receive emails from people interested on getting in touch with you.

NOTE: For the form to work and send emails you only need to put your own email address in the fetch option found withing the submit event code replacing the "YOUR-EMAIL-HERE" text with the email address that you want to use to receive those emails.

If any suggestions or questions just let me know I'll be glad to team-up.
